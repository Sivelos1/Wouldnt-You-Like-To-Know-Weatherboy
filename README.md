## Installation

Click on [this URL](https://sivelos1.github.io/Wouldnt-You-Like-To-Know-Weatherboy/) to visit the page.

## Usage

Go to the search bar on the left-hand side of the screen. Type in the city of your choosing, and then click the search button. This should fetch information from openmapapi's weather API, which should then update the weather to display the current weather, as well as a five-day forecast of the next five days. The weather in the five-day forecast will be the weather around noon that day.

As you search, the last eight cities will be recorded and displayed beneath the search area for ease of access. Clicking these buttons will automatically fetch the weather for that city.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to create an Issue on the application's GitHub repo or contact me in another fashion.

## Tests

Please try to search the weather for non-existant cities. An error message should appear, reporting a code of either 400 or 404. This is good! That means the app won't crash or cease to respond.
